# Eug-Records - Personal vinyl record collection SPA
A web application project about my personal record collection

# About the App

Eug Records is a personal vinyl record collection web app, it was a built to help keep track of my personal vinyl collection and my musical equipment that I use
to listen to music. In addition it was built to help people who may get interested in record collecting to get into the hobby, learn about releases and purchase them through discogs.
The app was built with the help of an API which was pulled from www.discogs.com.  

To browse through the record collection, add records to cart and get re-directed to discogs you must first register an account.
