# Eug-Records - Personal vinyl record collection SPA
A web application project about my personal record collection

# About the App

Eug Records is a personal vinyl record collection web app, it was a built to help keep track of my personal vinyl collection and my musical equipment that I currently own as a record collector and enthusiast. 
In addition it was built to help people who may get interested in record collecting to get into the hobby, learn about releases and purchase them through discogs.

In this project I have used an API to pull information from my account on www.discogs.com - the biggest library/platform for music collectors

To be able to access the collection page you must first register an account!

On Eug Records you will be able to:

<li>Browse through my personal record collection
<li>View detailed information about each release
<li>Add the releases to your cart
<li>A purchase button within the cart that will redirect you straight to the purchase page of a specific release on discogs.com
<li>Upon registration, you can choose to be an admin. You will then be able to edit the content of some pages.
